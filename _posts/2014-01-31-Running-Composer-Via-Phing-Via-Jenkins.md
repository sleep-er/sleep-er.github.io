I have set up [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) to run a [Phing](http://www.phing.info/) task every time we commit to our repo, php-lint,
documentor, mess detector and a few other.  This is working perfectly but I wanted to expand it to perform `composer install`.  Now Phing can 
do this via [ComposerTask](http://www.phing.info/docs/guide/stable-legacy/chapters/appendixes/AppendixC-OptionalTasks.html#ComposerTask) but 
not when using a svn repo and called via Jenkins.

When run via Phing this is the error you get

{% highlight bash %}
Package could not be downloaded, can not ask for authentication in non interactive mode (svn: OPTIONS of 'http://svn.repo/reponame/trunk': authorization failed: Could not authenticate to server: rejected Basic challenge (http://svn.repo/reponame/trunk)  
{% endhighlight %}

Lets take a step back and have a look at the composer.json file

{% highlight javascript %}
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "url": "http://svn.repo/reponame/",
            "type": "svn"
        }
    ],  
    "require": {
        "dmakin/reponame" : ">=1.0.0"
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Try adding user and password details?
My first theory was to try adding the username and password to the url `"url": "http://user:password@svn.repo/reponame/",` but that still came back with the 
same error.

## Try storing the login details?
The next idea was to run `composer install` from the cmd line on the Jenkins box as the jenkins user in the hope that the credentials
would then be stored and available for the web interface.

{% highlight bash %}
sudo su jenkins
cd /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/JobName/workspce
composer install
{% endhighlight %}

Composer then asked me for my svn login details and pulled the packages in successfully.  Good start but the web interface still had issues.

## Solution
After wondering if this was going to be possible at all I figured I would repeat my last attempt.  It was asking me for my credentials, why would this be as 
they should be stored?

Turns out they where not being stored.  A quick edit of `~/.subversion/config`, uncommenting the lines with `store-passwords` and `store-auth-creds` 
and setting them to yes, a quick run of `composer install` to save the svn login details then allowed me to run the Jenkins task and it worked.  Hurrah!
