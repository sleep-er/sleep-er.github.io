<p>
I kept seeing posts about Jekyll and how it would create static websites from plain text and you can even add in a little code to help out.
Even better some of them mentioned you can get GitHub to host the code, generate the html and display the site for you.  Free hosting and a chance
 to play around with an exciting piece of tech, count me in!
