    Hi, this is my site, about me.  I am a PHP Developer based in Manchester UK.  I am mainly a backend developer but have
    been known to dabble with the front end.  
    
    I have used frameworks, Drupal, Silex, Symfony, but do not know why certain companies hold framework X as the pinnacle
    and cannot comprehend that seasoned developers will be able to pick up X within a few weeks.
